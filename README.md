# Anomaly-Detection-in-Cybersecurity

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on anomaly detection in cybersecurity. The project includes a model trained for anomaly detection, along with preprocessing modules and real-time integration for detecting anomalies in network data.

## Files Included

- **anomaly_detection_model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the trained Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) model for anomaly detection.
- **anomaly_detection.py**: Real-time anomaly detection program suitable for integration.
- **KDDTrain+.txt**: Dataset used for training and testing the model (KDDTrain+ used in the project).
- **preprocess+model_file.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook comprising the trained model and preprocessing code used in the project.
- **preprocessing_module.py**: Preprocessing module containing functions and commands for data preprocessing tailored for this project.
- **trained_model.h5**: Saved model file (HDF5 format) that can be imported and used in `anomaly_detection.py` for real-time integration.

## Usage

- **anomaly_detection_model.ipynb**: Open this notebook to explore the trained model and understand the anomaly detection process.
- **anomaly_detection.py**: Use this file for real-time anomaly detection integration into your system.
- **KDDTrain+.txt**: Dataset used for training the model.
- **preprocess+model_file.ipynb**: Access this notebook to study the preprocessing techniques applied to the data before training the model.
- **preprocessing_module.py**: Utilize this module to preprocess your own data using the functions provided.
- **trained_model.h5**: Import this model into `anomaly_detection.py` for real-time anomaly detection.

## How to Use

1. Open `anomaly_detection_model.ipynb` to understand the model and its performance on the provided dataset.
2. Explore `preprocess_model_file.ipynb` to understand the preprocessing steps applied to the dataset.
3. Use `preprocessing_module.py` to preprocess your data similarly.
4. Import `trained_model.h5` into `anomaly_detection.py` for real-time anomaly detection integration.
